# Project Title

In the course Advanced Softwareengineering the task for the semester has been to apply several Software Engineering techniques on a pet project. My idea was building a prototype for an app which guides you through the nightlife of a city, e.g. Berlin.

## Tasks

1) UML (at least 3 diagrams)
2) Metrics (at least two. Sonarcube would be great)
3) Clean Code Development (at least 5 points you can show me)
4) Build Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc.
5) Continous Delivery (show me your pipeline in e.g. Jenkins and Travis-CI)
6) DSL (Create a small DSL Demo example snippet in your code even if it does not contribute to your project)
7) Functional Programming (prove that you have covered all functional definitions in your code as

    only final data structures
    (mostly) side effect free functions
    the use of higher order functions
    functions as parameters and return values
    use clojures / anonymous functions
